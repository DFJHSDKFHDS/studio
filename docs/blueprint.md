- Unit Fetch and Selection: Fetches available units from the user profile to display for each item in the cart, allowing the selection of the unit.
- Dynamic Cart Display: Renders a dynamic, sortable, searchable list of items in the cart to create the gatepass from.
- Gate Pass Text Generation: Generates a plain text representation of the gate pass, incorporating the selected units for each item.
- Data Storage: Saves gate pass data including item details and the selected units to local storage or a temporary session.
